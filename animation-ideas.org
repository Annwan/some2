* Listing all the binary trees

In order to explain the dynamic programming algorithm, we need to
explicitly list all the trees with 1, 3, 5, 7 nodes.
A quick remark about Catalan numbers may fit or not.

* Animation of the dynamic programming algorithm
- animate the coin tossing
- choice of k -> generation of subtrees

* Animation of Boltzmann generation of binary trees
- quickly running random generation â†’ stopped
- compare with the threshold value
- do what it requests to do

* Geometric R.V.

* Animate the generation of a plane tree
- generate 3 siblings
- incomplete trees are greyed out
- continuing (in parallel) / depending on how long it takes Manim to
compile the animation

* Put the colors on the nodes of a tree
- a tree with 20 vertices
- use 3 or 4 colors

* Idea: probabilities of the events are proportional to the contributions of the summands -> what is the Boltzmann distribution
- animation 1: equation for the generating function of the binary tree
    - the equation $T(z) = z + z T^2(z)$
    - the solution $T(z) = \dfrac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4z^2}}{2z}$
    - $z = 0.1$ -> which portions are contributed from each of the summands
    - $z = 0.2$ -> portions are changed
    - show how $z$ is approaching $0.25$, and how the branching
probabilities change
- animation 2: ...

* What is the multiparametric Boltzmann distribution
- the two operations (disjoint union and cartesian product)
- animate the equations
- 1d -> a linear array of coefficients of the generating function
- 2d -> animate the table
- the sum goes over several dimensions, just a formula
